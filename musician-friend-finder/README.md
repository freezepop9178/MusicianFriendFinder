This Project is intended to be a fun project, as well as creating a way for musicians everywhere to connect with other musical people. 

There should be a few things that this will include;
- A map of your area, with musicians showing their locations as well (this may change depending on what I think)
- A list of users, that includes instrument preferred, skill, as well as contact information (as allowed by user)
- Listings of music stores and other possible things; venues, contact information for clubs, places to play, etc.
- An about page
- Not sure what else at this point
